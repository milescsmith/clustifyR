\usage{
kl_divergence(vec1, vec2, if_logcounts = FALSE, total_reads = 1000,
  max_KL = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{vec1}{Test vector}

\item{vec2}{Reference vector}

\item{if_logcounts}{Whether the vectors are log-transformed. If so, the
raw count should be computed before computing KL-divergence.}

\item{total_reads}{Pseudo-library size}

\item{max_KL}{Maximal allowed value of KL-divergence.}
}
\description{
Use package entropy to compute Kullback-Leibler divergence.
The function first converts each vector's reads to pseudo-number of
transcripts by normalizing the total reads to total_reads.
The normalized read for each gene is then rounded to serve as the
pseudo-number of transcripts.
Function \code{\link[entropy:KL.shrink]{entropy::KL.shrink()}} is called to compute the KL-divergence between
the two vectors, and the maximal allowed divergence is set to max_KL.
Finally, a linear transform is performed to convert the KL divergence,
which is between 0 and max_KL, to a similarity score between -1 and 1.
